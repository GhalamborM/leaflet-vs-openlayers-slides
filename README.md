# "Leaflet vs Openlayers" slides

Clone and open up `slides.html` in any decent web browser. 

The slides are organized in sections (arrow key left/right). To see slides within a section, use arrow key up/down.

The slides use Reveal.js, Leaflet and Openlayers. They are free software projects and I guess you're cleverenough to check their licenses if you need to.

The slides themselves are CC-by-sa.
